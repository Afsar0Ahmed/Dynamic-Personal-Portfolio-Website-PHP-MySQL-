# Dynamic-Personal-Portfolio-Website-PHP-MySQL-
A full-stack portfolio site that uses PHP for server-side rendering and CRUD operations, allowing me to update projects, skills, and blog posts through a lightweight admin panelâ€”no code pushes required. The front end stays clean and fast, while the back end lets non-technical users (a future-me!) manage content easily.
